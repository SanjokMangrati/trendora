# Trendora - eCommerce Web App

Trendora is an eCommerce web app with an admin dashboard, designed to showcase basic eCommerce functionalities. This app allows users to add products to their cart, manage product quantities, apply discounts, and place orders. The admin dashboard provides tools for managing discounts, viewing store analytics.

## Features
